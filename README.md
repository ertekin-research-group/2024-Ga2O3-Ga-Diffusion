# 2024-Ga2O3-Ga-Diffusion
This repository hosts the generated and analyzed data for the study of 'Investigation of Ga interstitial and vacancy diffusion in β-Ga2O3 via split defects: a direct approach via master diffusion equations.' 
It contains detailed atomic structures and diffusion pathways, highlighting the intricate behavior of intrinsic defects and their impact on Ga self-diffusion in β-Ga2O3.

## Repository Contents

### A) POSCAR Files for Defect Structures
- **A1) POSCARs for N-split Ga Interstitials**: Atomic structures of N-split Ga interstitials across four different supercells (1x4x2, 1x4x3, 2x4x2, and 2x4x3).
- **A2) POSCARs for N-split Ga Vacancies**: Atomic structures of N-split Ga vacancies in the same set of supercells as A1.

### B) NEB Calculations for Principal Hops
- **B1) Identified Principal Hops for Ga Interstitials**: Intermediate structures from NEB calculations for principal hops of the Ga interstitial diffusion, which cannot be decomposed into other sets of hops, between defect states in A1, including gif animations.
- **B2) Identified Principal Hops for Ga Vacancies**: Similar to B1, this includes data for principal hops of the Ga vacancy diffusion with corresponding gif animations.

### C) Fastest Diffusion Pathways
- **C1) Fastest Pathways for Ga Interstitial Diffusion**: The fastest diffusion pathways for Ga interstitials in three different crystallographic orientations (a*, b, c) with images and gif animations.
- **C2) Fastest Pathways for Ga Vacancy Diffusion**: Similar to B1, this includes the fastest pathways for Ga vacancy diffusion, also in three orientations.

## Usage
This data is intended to support the findings of our study on Ga diffusion in β-Ga2O3. Researchers can utilize these structures and pathways to further understand the diffusion mechanisms or to compare with other computational or experimental studies.
